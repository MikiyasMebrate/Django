# Froala

To use Froala Editor in your Django project, you can follow these steps:

1. Install the Froala Editor package in your project using pip:
    
    ```
    pip install django-froala-editor
    
    ```
    
2. Add `'froala_editor'` to the `INSTALLED_APPS` list in your project's `settings.py` file:
    
    ```
    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        # ...
        'froala_editor',
    ]
    
    ```
    
3. Add the Froala Editor URLs to your project's `urls.py` file:
    
    ```
    from django.urls import path, include
    
    urlpatterns = [
        # ...
        path('froala_editor/', include('froala_editor.urls')),
    ]
    
    ```
    
4. In your model, add a `FroalaField` field to the model where you want to use the editor:
    
    ```
    from django.db import models
    from froala_editor.fields import FroalaField
    
    class MyModel(models.Model):
        content = FroalaField()
    
    ```
    
5. In your form, add a `FroalaEditor` widget to the field that uses the `FroalaField`:
    
    ```
    from django import forms
    from froala_editor.widgets import FroalaEditor
    
    class PageForm(forms.ModelForm):
      content = forms.CharField(widget=FroalaEditor)
    
    ```
    
6. In your template, render the form with the `FroalaEditor` widget:
    
    ```
    {{ form.media }}
    <form method="post">
      {% csrf_token %}
      {{ form.as_p }}
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
    
    ```
    

To print the content of a FroalaField in Django, you can use the `safe` filter in your template. Here's an example:

```
{% extends 'base.html' %}

{% block content %}
  <h1>{{ post.title }}</h1>
  <p>{{ post.content|safe }}</p>
{% endblock %}

```

In this example, `post.content` is a FroalaField that contains HTML content. The `safe` filter tells Django to render the HTML as-is, rather than escaping it.

Note that using the `safe` filter can be a security risk if you're displaying user-generated content. Be sure to sanitize any user input to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

That's it! Your Django project should now be using Froala Editor.
