# Templets

To render your HTML templates, go to your application and create a new folder called "templates". If you misspell the name, Django won't be able to find it. Once you have created the folder, create your HTML document, for example, index.html.
Previously, we worked with ‘HttpResponse’ in views. Now we'll see how to render an HTML file. For example, if you have an index.html file in your templates folder, you can render it in views.

```python
def home_view(request):
    return render(request, 'index.html', {})
#render have requires mainly 3 arguments 1.Requiest, 2.Which html file is render, 3.Dictionaries
#we'll talk about this 
#boom It's works 
```

- Don’t forget you should include this function into URLs

---

- Another way to add your templates create folder anywhere in your project then we’ll tell django where it’ll be find it.

Example: let my templates in main directory 

- Then go to main project setting and find ‘TEMPLATES’ and go to ‘DIRS’ → means also add this directory

 

```python
'DIRS' : [
     BASE_DIRS / 'templates' #BASE_DIRS go back to your parrent folder then find templates
 ]
```
